## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla javascript

### What I learned

This was interesting one. It help me to relearn CSS perspective and 3D space. which I hardly implement. I learned more about animation timing, fill-mode, and controlling animation delay.

### Continued development

I am focusing more on clean code and declarative programming style.

### Useful resources

- [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode) - This helped me for animation-fill-mode and usage of backward and forward css property.
